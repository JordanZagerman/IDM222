                    <h2 class="linklessTitle">1. Missile Game </h2>
                    <p class="paragraph">I enjoyed playing this game because it had intuitive controls, and it took up the whole screen. I was immediately immersed in the gameplay. The other cool part about Missile Game, was that there was a qualifying level to start the game. Meaning that there was a brief period of no obstacles so the player could understand the controls. The qualifying level also gave the player an opportunity to look around, and check out the game’s heads up display interface. The game could use color more effectively. It’s cool that it only kicks in when you crash, but it could be a bigger splash, or a screen wash. Missile could also benefit from some sort of power up incentive to for the player to chase. Right now the mission is pretty basic, just avoid the walls.It would be nice if there was something to chase, as well as something to dodge. e </p>

                    <h2 class="linklessTitle">2. Sinuous Game</h2>
                    <p class="paragraph">I enjoyed playing this game because it gave me a lot of elements to strategize with, while still being fast paced. I had to dodge the red beams, while also seeking out blue power ups. It wasn’t all smiles and rainbows though. The game could have used color variations better when gaining power ups, and losing lives. Sinuous could’ve also had the red dots change direction at some point. Since the flow always came from the top right, it was logical for the player to operate mainly in the bottom left. If the dots switched directions, the player would utilize more of the canvas. Other minor details that bothered me included having a visible cursor, and having the game end if the cursor left the canvas. Besides that, I really liked the gameplay.</p>

                    <h2 class="linklessTitle">3. X-TYPE Game</h2>
					<p class="paragraph">I enjoyed playing this game because it gave me something to attack, something to avoid, and WASD controls. The game also had really strong graphics, sounds, and music. I don’t have many critiques for X-TYPE, but it could have used color more effectively. Specifically, leveling up and/or losing a life could have been more colorful. Other than that, it would’ve been nice if the canvas filled the screen. Even if it was just a theater-mode effect, where the same canvas is on a black backdrop. It would have further immersed the player into the gameplay.</p>
