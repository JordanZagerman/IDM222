					<p class="paragraph">	I am a Philadelphia based artist, web developer, and writer. I am currently attending Drexel University as an Interactive Digital Media major. If you found this website, I probably know you, or I am seeking employment from you. If you’re looking for Jordan Zagerman of Ottawa, try JordanZagerman.com. Either way, thank you for checking it out. One of my goals for this website is to display work I have done within my community. To make websites for small businesses, and get first hand experience while I’m still in college.</p>
